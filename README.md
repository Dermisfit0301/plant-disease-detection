# plant-disease-detection-project
This was a capstone project for Informatics Research Labs. This project uses computer vision algorithms to detect whether a plant has a disease or not and then further tells which kind of disease the plant has. 

This repository has the following components:
1.The source code 
2. The application
3.The logo

**Note**:
Due to constraints of time and processing capacity, we have trained the model on limited plant types and images.
